        Welcome to Alchemy, an app which will help you discover and donate to charities in Ireland.
        \n\nTap a charity to see the donation options, and tap again to make a donation via text using your phone credit. Alchemy will prepare the text with the correct number and keyword - but you have to hit send to actually make the donation. You will get a message from the donation handling company confirming your donation was successful.
        \n\nAn AI generated summary of each charity is presented to help you learn about them. You can also visit their websites to learn more!.
